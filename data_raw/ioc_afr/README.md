# IOC Databases
These databases represent a consolidation of the AFRs submitted by local governments to the Illinois Office of the Comptroller. Files are downloaded directly from the IOC website. We extract data from the revenues table for this analysis. The access databases appears to be updated less frequently than the database behind the OIC's AFR web search tool, so may be missing some data available through the webtool.
